This setup is for working without the Arduino IDE.

Instead, it's command line based, using the make utility.
All the files needed for development under Windows are included.
The build still uses Arduino 0022's core libraries.
The toolchain is the one used by Arduino 0022.
The core libraries and toolchain are located in the arduino-0022 subdirectory.

A batch file, make.bat, is supplied to call up the included version of make.

Before trying to build for the first time, and every time that you download a new Makefile from the repository, or add a new source file to Makefile, run
  make depend

To build open_evse.hex:
  make
To load the firmware via a USBasp programmer:
  make fuses
To load the firmware via a USBasp programmer:
  make flash
To clean up intermediate files from the build process:
  make clean

Put any added libraries in the libraries subdirectory.

I've commented out the basic configuration #defines from open_evse.h. You
can control them via the CDEFS lines in Makefile without having to edit open_evse.h
